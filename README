Usage:
======
1.  Place the SchedulePages.module file into the 
    site/modules folder and install the plugin from the admin
    area.
    You can choose how often the cron requires to run. (thanks to
    Apeisa)
2.  The LazyCron module will be installed (if you haven't already).
    This module is part of the Processwire core, but it isn't
    activated by default.
3.  Add the following date fields to your template: 
    publish_from
    publish_until
    Note: the fields are already created during the 
	installation of the module
4.  That't all. LazyCron will run take care of (un)publishing
    your pages that have a the publish dates set.
    Please note: LazyCron hooks are only executed during 
    pageviews that are delivered by ProcessWire. They are not 
    executed when using ProcessWire's API from other scripts.

       timestamp
